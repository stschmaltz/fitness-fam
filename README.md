## Fitness-Fam

https://fitnessfam.app is an NextJS app I am putting together to create workout routines and browse from a database of exercises.

#### Tech

- NextJS (by extension React)
- MongoDB
- TypeScript
- GraphQL (using [NextJS route apis](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction))
- Chakra UI (https://chakra-ui.com/)

## Motivation

The goal of this app is to be able to easily look through a large database of exercises to put together exercise routines. I started building this for myself to put together a new home workout routine so I chose tech that is mostly familiar to me. There are however some unique aspects to this project that I am learning.

Those include:

- Chakra UI
- NextJS route apis
- Auth0
